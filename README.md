If you wanna run both rpc and aztec node on your vps, I suggest "VPS 4000 ARM G11".

Click on order now, fill the details and confirm your order.
# Payment
They'll email you your ccp login credentials which you can manage the payments and pay for your server. It doesn't support crypto payments.
ccp website: 
https://www.customercontrolpanel.de/

*if you are from a restricted country like me and there's no payment option for you, you can get visa card from "paywithmoon" and add funds to it with crypto (Btc and usdt)
# manage vps
After paying for your server, they'll email you your vps ip and password and scp login credentials. 
In scp you can manage your vps. Link:
https://www.servercontrolpanel.de/SCP/
# client 
After getting your vps, you need a client to connect to your vps through SSH. Download and use moboxterm or termius.

search them in google
(personally I'm using moboxterm pro cracked version)
# connect to your vps
Connect to the vps via Mobaxterm

1- Click session and open SSH tab

2- Enter root@yourIPaddress in remote host

3- Click on OK and then a terminal opens which needs your password, Copy it & Paste it in the terminal by clicking Mouse Middle Scroll Wheel. (Password will be hidden in terminal)

you have successfully connected to your vps.
# config your vps
You should config your vps. Netcup uses Debian OS and German language for their servers. there's not much difference between debian and ubuntu so don't worry 

# change the language to English:
```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
```
go through the whole list and deselect the German language. 

Than select : en_US.UTF8

move up/down - using the arrows key
space key - select or deselect

tab key - to change the button ( move to OK button once done and press enter)
# install docker
```bash
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Remove any existing Docker packages
for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose podman-docker containerd runc; do
  sudo apt-get remove -y $pkg
done

# Install required packages for Docker repo
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg

# Create keyrings directory
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

# Add Docker GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Add Docker repository for Debian
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Update package index
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Docker packages
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# Test Docker installation
